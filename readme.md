# Candidacy Examination

In my third year as a graduate student in Clinical Psychology at The Ohio State University, I completed my candidacy examination through a quantitative study of missingness in dyadic contexts in Spring 2023, *Best Practices for Multiple Imputation in the Context of the Actor-Partner Interdependence Model*. The repository contains relevant code and output from my candidacy examination. No raw or simulated data is included in this repository.
