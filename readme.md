I am a graduate student in clinical psychology at The Ohio State University. The repository contains relevant code and output from my candidacy examination project, *Best Practices for Multiple Imputation in the Context 
of the Actor-Partner Interdependence Model* from Spring 2023. No raw or simulated data is included in this repository.
